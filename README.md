# Promxy [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/jacksontj/promxy.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/jacksontj/promxy) [![GoDoc](https://godoc.org/github.com/jacksontj/promxy?status.svg)](https://godoc.org/github.com/jacksontj/promxy)

## High-level overview
Promxy is a prometheus proxy that makes many shards of prometheus
appear as a single node to the user. This significantly simplifies operations and use
of prometheus at scale (when you have more than one prometheus host).

## Quickstart
Release binaries are available on the [releases](https://github.com/jacksontj/promxy/releases) page.

If you are interested in hacking on promxy (or just running your own build), you can install via `go get`:

```
go get -u github.com/jacksontj/promxy/cmd/promxy
```

An example configuration file is available in the [repo](https://github.com/jacksontj/promxy/blob/master/cmd/promxy/config.yaml).

With that configuration modified and ready, all that is left is to run promxy:

```
./promxy --config=config.yaml
```
